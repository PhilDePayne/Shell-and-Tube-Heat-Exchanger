# Shell and Tube Heat Exchanger
A Unity program which simulates a shell and tube heat exchanger.

## Description
This program visualises the changes in temperatures of two fluids in a shell and sube heat exchanger.

## How to use

Select one of the available fluids from the dropdown menus. Set the desired temperatures for both fluids, length, radius and heat coefficient for the heat exchanger. Press *Calculate* to show the changes in temperatures. A *data.txt* file will be created, containing the temperatures of both fluids at all the calculated positions along the length of the heat exchanger.

## Disclaimer
I'm not a physicist/fluid mechanics expert, and the simulation itself is simplified, so results are not 100% accurate. The formulas used here were derived based on [this simulation](https://learncheme.com/simulations/heat-transfer/heat-exchanger/).
